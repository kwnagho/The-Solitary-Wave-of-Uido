# The Solitary Wave of Uido: Unified Dynamics Theory (UDT)

This repository presents the **Unified Dynamics Theory (UDT)**, which posits that all phenomena in the universe emerge from the nonlinear dynamics of a single 4-dimensional Quaternion Phase Field ($\Phi$). UDT assumes that mass, force, and spacetime spontaneously emerge through the intrinsic dynamics of $\Phi$, providing the philosophical foundation of "OMNIA SCIENTA UNITA (All Knowledge is United)."

UDT defines $\Phi$ with the dimension of 'Action' ($[ML^2T^{-1}]$). By non-dimensionalizing the constants of the UDT equation using fundamental constants (h, c, G), all dimensionless coefficients were found to be very close to '1' (1.002, 0.997, 1.011), demonstrating that UDT is derived from **'First Principles'**.

**Key Achievements:**
* **Successful 3D Hydrogen Atom Simulation:** Using only UDT's dynamics, the theory accurately predicted the electron's ground state binding energy of -13.605 eV.
* **Reproduction of Cosmic Phenomena without Dark Matter/Energy:** UDT successfully reproduced galaxy rotation curves without dark matter and cosmic accelerated expansion without dark energy.
* **Reproduction of Magnetic Fields and Lorentz Force:** Simulations demonstrated the spontaneous formation of magnetic fields, within which electron solitons move in circular orbits due to the Lorentz force.

This repository provides the core theory of UDT, its simulation methodology, and simulation results for various physical phenomena, along with relevant visual materials (images, animations).

## 1. Core Equation of Unified Dynamics Theory (UDT)

All phenomena in UDT are described by the nonlinear dynamical equation for a single 4-dimensional Quaternion Phase Field $\Phi(x, y, z, t) = w + ixi + jxj + kxk$. The physical dimension of $\Phi$ is **'Action'** ($[\Phi] = [M L^2 T^{-1}]$).

$$ \Box\Phi + \alpha(\nabla \times \Phi) + \beta\Phi|\Phi|^2 + \Gamma(\partial/\partial t |\Phi|^2)\Phi = J(\Phi) $$

The meaning of each term is as follows:

* **$\Box\Phi$ (D'Alembertian Term):** Describes the wave propagation of the field. ($\Box = \partial^2/\partial t^2 - c^2\nabla^2$).
* **$\alpha(\nabla \times \Phi)$ (Coiling Term):** Induces rotation (curl) in the field, generating spin-like interactions and forces (e.g., magnetic fields). The constant $\alpha$ has the dimension of acceleration ([$LT^{-2}$]).
* **$\beta\Phi|\Phi|^2$ (Nonlinear Self-Interaction Term):** Contributes to soliton formation and stabilization.
* **$\Gamma(\partial/\partial t |\Phi|^2)\Phi$ (Convergence Term):** A term related to the rate of phase change, inducing energy dissipation or system convergence.
* **$J(\Phi)$ (Source/Sink Term):** Represents external interactions or field generation.

**Advice:**
* This content can be included in `README.md` for quick understanding, or you can create a separate file such as `UDT_Equation_Details.md` or `Theory.pdf` within a `docs/` or `theory/` folder for more detailed explanations.
* LaTeX equations will render on GitHub Markdown when enclosed with `$` or `$$ $$.

## 2. Simulation Methodology

UDT tracks the spatio-temporal evolution of a 4-dimensional Quaternion Phase Field $\Phi$ through numerical simulations to reproduce various physical phenomena. Below is the pseudocode for the general UDT simulation loop.

```python
# Constants derived from fundamental principles
ALPHA = 1.002
BETA = 0.997
GAMMA = 1.011

# Main simulation loop
FOR FROM 0 TO TIME_STEPS:
    # 1. Compute D'Alembertian term (wave propagation)
    DALEMBERT_TERM = compute_dalembertian(PHI_FIELD)

    # 2. Compute Coiling term (force generation, e.g., magnetic field)
    COILING_TERM = ALPHA * compute_curl(PHI_FIELD)

    # 3. Compute Nonlinear Self-Interaction term (soliton formation)
    NONLINEAR_TERM = BETA * PHI_FIELD * abs(PHI_FIELD)**2

    # 4. Compute Convergence term (energy dissipation/stability)
    CONVERGENCE_TERM = GAMMA * compute_phase_change_rate(PHI_FIELD) * PHI_FIELD

    # 5. Compute Source/Sink term (external interactions, if applicable)
    SOURCE_SINK_TERM = compute_source_sink(PHI_FIELD)

    # Update Phi field based on the sum of all terms
    NEW_PHI_FIELD = PHI_FIELD + DELTA_T * (DALEMBERT_TERM + COILING_TERM +
                                            NONLINEAR_TERM + CONVERGENCE_TERM + SOURCE_SINK_TERM)
    PHI_FIELD = NEW_PHI_FIELD
